        <p class="description">A new strategy and redesign for an under-developed brand.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Along with BoatTrader.com and Yachtworld.com, Boats.com is a boating classifieds site from Dominion Marine Media (DMM). The largest of the three, it combines listings from both of the sites mentioned above with a large amount of boating lifestyle content. Outside of the US, it also serves as DMM’s primary brand. DMM approached my team to redefine Boats.com’s strategy, design, and experience. I was responsible for architecture, design, and front-end prototyping.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Boats.com was a site without direction or qualities to differentiate it from its siblings. Its core strength is its lifestyle content, which was being relegated to a small carousel on the home page.</p>
        <h3>My goal</h3>
        <p>I wanted to make boating lifestyle content the highlight of the site. Classifieds are also important, as they’re revenue generating, so integrating them in a smart way was also key.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>As with the other DMM projects, my team performed in depth research with users of Boats.com before we started the design process. We sent a survey to ~10,000 consumers, asking them about their experience buying and selling boats, and how Boats.com served them in those roles. As expected, their feedback was very valuable.</p>
        <h4>Architecture</h4>
        <p>“Getting it right” on Boats.com required revisiting its architecture. My team evaluated the sites’s content, including its library of over 1000 articles, to make informed navigation and taxonomy changes. We created navigational flows and wireframes to explore these changes.</p>

            {% endfor %}

    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>Mood boards</h4>
        <p>As this was the third project I’d worked on with the DMM team, I had insight from the first two to guide my decision making. As with those sites, I started the project with a mood board exercise to gauge brand perception within the stakeholder group.</p>

        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>I designed a few options for both mobile and desktop based around Boats.com’s existing brand standards and color palette.</p>

        <p>Once the initial round of design was done, we once again engaged Boats.com’s users to survey their opinions. Based on their responses, our research, and feedback from the stakeholders, we came to a final, revised design direction.</p>

        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>As a last step before handing the design off to Boats.com’s development team, I built responsive front-end prototypes to explore interactions on both desktop and mobile. As expected with client feedback, the design changed a bit once I began prototyping, but it retains most of the design I started with.</p>
