        <p class="description">Redesigning an established boating brand.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Like its sibling sites YachtWorld.com and Boats.com, BoatTrader.com is a boating classifieds site from Dominion Marine Media (DMM). As the largest and longest-standing of its online properties, BoatTrader.com gets in excess of 30 million page views a year. DMM approached my team to redefine the site’s design and experience. I was responsible for design and front-end prototyping.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Boat Trader’s website was successful and highly trafficked, but the design left a lot to be desired. Coupled with a limited mobile site, the overall user experience was due for an upgrade.</p>
        <h3>My goal</h3>
        <p>I wanted to bring BoatTrader.com into the era of mobile-first thinking. I wanted a design that worked well on any device, with an emphasis on an easy to use search and navigation and a clean, accessible aesthetic.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>My team performed in depth research by surveying nearly 10,000 users of BoatTrader.com, asking them about their experience buying and selling boats, and how Boat Trader served them in those roles. As expected, their feedback was valuable, and we covered the walls of our office with insight from the users. We also created personas for typical users of the site.</p>

        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>With research in hand, my team led Boat Trader’s stakeholders through a mood board exercise. This gave me a lot of insight about the stakeholders’ perception of the brand. I spent the following weeks in the design phase, creating several mockups of possible home page designs. I explored different strategies, including an “omnibox” search, as well as focusing on listings and filtering with search results as the home page.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>After the initial round of design, we engaged Boat Trader’s users to survey their opinions. Based on their responses, our research, and feedback from the stakeholders, we came to a final design direction. I focused on a simple search to get users into listings as quickly as possible. I also addressed BoatTrader.com’s revenue needs, with the hero area being dedicated to a large featured listing they could sell.</p>

        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p>As a last step before handing the design off to Boat Trader’s development team, I built responsive front-end prototypes to explore interactions on both desktop and mobile. Since this was my first project with the Dominion Marine Media team, The design evolved quite a bit during the prototype stage.</p>
