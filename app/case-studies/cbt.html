        <p class="description">An ongoing, iterative redesign of a web&nbsp;app.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Over the past two years, my team at Simple Focus has helped CrossBrowserTesting.com design and develop a world-class web app. I established the creative direction early on in the project, and we’re constantly iterating and improving the experience. In my time working with CBT, the app’s user base has more than doubled to nearly&nbsp;90,000.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>CrossBrowserTesting.com has always had a strong product &mdash; easy testing of websites across multiple operating systems and browsers from the comfort of your computer. When I began working on the product, the UI was clunky and outdated, with bits and pieces of open source design frameworks and icon packs scattered about. Launching a live test was difficult to navigate, with a table based and overly complex UI. My first order of business was to dream up a simpler experience.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <p>I began the project on paper. I sketched several ideas for the core functionality of the app at the time &mdash; choosing a browser and operating system to test.</p>

    <div class="examples">
        <div class="example"><img src="/img/projects/cbt/sketches/sketch-1.jpg" alt="Sketches of CrossBrowserTesting's live test picker"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>My next step was diving head-first into the UI. Based around a common color palette, I explored both the aesthetic of the overall site as well as the specific interactions of the live test picker.</p>

            {% endfor %}

        <h3>Bringing it together</h3>
        <p>In the end, the team at CrossBrowserTesting.com went with a simple UI that's still evolving today.</p>

        <p>Since I began the project, the app has grown to include screenshot testing and automated Selenium testing.
