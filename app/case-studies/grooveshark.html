        <p>Grooveshark engaged my team at Simple Focus at the earliest stage of the design process: concepting and ideating on innovative homepage ideas for a new version of Grooveshark.com, without any limitations. The project was meant to bring an outside perspective to a product team that was deeply embedded in the current version of the&nbsp;app.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <p>I start most design projects on paper. The flexibility and freedom of sketching often leads to an outpouring of ideas. Some are good, most are bad, but they're all on paper, which is important. I challenge myself with an excercise called "4x4ing" â€“ producing four crude but strategically different ideas in four minutes. The process is taxing, but forces me to move quickly and think on my feet. It produces fragments of solid ideas that can usually be pulled together into a few viable&nbsp;options.</p>

        <h3>The result</h3>
        <p>Over the course of a few days, I produced dozens of sketches and several high fidelity design ideas. The project was a success, and elements from a few of my designs are now in the core product direction of the next generation of Grooveshark's app. The screens below are a small sample of the designs I produced during the&nbsp;project.</p>
