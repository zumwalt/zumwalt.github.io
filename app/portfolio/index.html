        <p class="description">An ongoing, iterative redesign of a web&nbsp;app.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Over the past two years, my team at Simple Focus has helped CrossBrowserTesting.com design and develop a world-class web app. I established the creative direction early on in the project, and we’re constantly iterating and improving the experience. In my time working with CBT, the app’s user base has more than doubled to nearly&nbsp;90,000.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>CrossBrowserTesting.com has always had a strong product &mdash; easy testing of websites across multiple operating systems and browsers from the comfort of your computer. When I began working on the product, the UI was clunky and outdated, with bits and pieces of open source design frameworks and icon packs scattered about. Launching a live test was difficult to navigate, with a table based and overly complex UI. My first order of business was to dream up a simpler experience.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <p>I began the project on paper. I sketched several ideas for the core functionality of the app at the time &mdash; choosing a browser and operating system to test.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples">
        <div class="example"><img src="/img/projects/cbt/sketches/sketch-1.jpg" alt="Sketches of CrossBrowserTesting's live test picker"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>My next step was diving head-first into the UI. Based around a common color palette, I explored both the aesthetic of the overall site as well as the specific interactions of the live test picker.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples slideshow">
        <ul class="slides">

            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Bringing it together</h3>
        <p>In the end, the team at CrossBrowserTesting.com went with a simple UI that's still evolving today. Since I began the project, the app has grown to include screenshot testing and automated Selenium testing. The screens below are pulled from the live application, which can be accessed (with a free trial) at <a rel="noreferrer" href="http://crossbrowsertesting.com">CrossBrowserTesting.com</a></p>

        <p class="description">An in-progress marketing site for a simple team productivity&nbsp;app.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Project List is a simple project dashboard built by my team at Simple Focus to facilitate our stand-up meetings. It tracks a few simple metrics, like status and percent complete, to help us quickly understand what each team member is working on. As we begin to introduce the product to outside users and teams, I'm redesigning the marketing site to better showcase Project List's features and&nbsp;benefits.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Project List's <a href="http://projectlist.com" rel="noreferrer">current marketing site</a> is a bit limited in the way it's designed (by myself, admittedly). It is difficult to add new content, and the site wasn't designed with collecting payments or adding outside users in&nbsp;mind.</p>
        <h3>My goal</h3>
        <p>I wanted to give Project List a proper marketing site &mdash; one that can grow as the product does. The site should be able to support multiple pages of content and entice users to sign&nbsp;up.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <p>As this is an internal, non-billing project, my time was limited. I dove in head first with a few sketches to quickly get ideas on&nbsp;paper.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples slideshow">
        <ul class="slides">
            {% for sketch in page.pl_sketches %}
                <li class="slide"><img src="/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-{{ sketch }}.jpg"></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Bringing it together</h3>
        <p>In the end, I made the decision to promote Project List's responsive, mobile-first view. Standup meetings are often held away from desks and laptops, so I want users to know that Project List works on their phones. I chose a simple color palette and aesthetic with a focus on typography. I also added a few illustrative elements to accompany Project List's mascot, the Project List Robot. The screens below are snippets of a few pages from the new&nbsp;site.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Preboarding</h2>
        <p class="description">An app for facilitating mood board exercises.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>My team at Simple Focus often does mood board exercises with clients at the beginning of projects. It serves as a way to create a visual vocabulary when they speak about their brand. What <em>does</em> "clean" actually mean when it comes to&nbsp;design?</p>

        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>As a stakeholder, contributing to a mood board is difficult if you can't be in the room. I find mood boards, and the insight they provide, to be invaluable when I get into the design process, so I wanted to create a solution that allowed remote stakeholders to contribute from anywhere. Why not build an&nbsp;app?</p>

        <h3>My goal</h3>
        <p>I wanted to build an app that allowed individual users to collaborate in real time with their fellow stakeholders by placing "stickers" on different elements of a mood board. I wanted each sticker to contain the user's initials and a color reflecting their opinion (green for "on brand", red for "off brand", and blue for "aspirational"). I also wanted to be able to watch the exercise unfold in real time in my&nbsp;browser.</p>

        <h3>My process</h3>
        <img src="/img/projects/preboarding/whiteboard.jpg">
        <p>I quickly sketched out a few of the core concepts on a whiteboard to get them out of my head. I chose Ruby on Rails as my framework due to its learning curve. I scaffolded out a simple application, added authentication with <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>, and built a mood board model and its accompanying controllers and views. Using the scaffolded CRUD interface for the mood board model, I added simple file uploading with <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a>. To enable real time communication between the different users of the apps, I integrated <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> to enable websocket connections between clients.</p>

        <h3>Bringing it together</h3>
        <p>Contrary to my nature, I saved design for last. I put together a simple UI for the app as a whole, and designed microinteractions for the addition and removal of the "stickers". The app is simple, nimble, and serves its purpose well. With everything in place, I have an interface that allows me to upload mood boards and allows stakeholders to interact with them. I can watch everything happen in real time, take notes, and ask informed questions afterwards. As a result, I'm able to have a clearer understanding of the stakeholders' brand and their expectations before I get too far into the design&nbsp;process.</p>

        <p class="description">A design overhaul for a neglected high-end classifieds&nbsp;site.</p>
        
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>My team at Simple Focus was engaged to redesign YachtWorld.com to reflect their users and the watercraft they feature. I was responsible for the design process and front-end prototyping.</p>

        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>For a site that nets around 20 million visits a year, YachtWorld.com is outdated, slow, and a pain to use. The process of searching for boats is overly complex and poorly designed, and the individual boat listings are busy and often uninformative.</p>
        
        <h3>Doing our research</h3>
        <p>Before thinking about design, my team conducted in-depth research and user interviews to gauge perception of YachtWorld.com and its user base. We asked them about themselves, their experiences buying and selling boats, and their interaction with YachtWorld.com in that capacity. We also performed a heuristic review of the site to identify existing UX problems and possible solutions, and we performed a competitive analysis of YachtWorld.com to contrast it with its competitors. As a last step before diving into design, I designed and led a mood board exercise with stakeholders from YachtWorld.com's team. The mood board gave me insight into how each stakeholder viewed YachtWorld.com's brand and the aspirations they had for the brand going forward. Armed with all of this information, I began the design process.</p>

        <div class="moodboard">
            <img src="/img/projects/yachtworld/moodboard.jpg" alt="">
            <img class="heatmap" src="/img/projects/yachtworld/moodboard-heatmap.jpg" alt="">
            <small>Tip: <span class="show-desktop">Hover over</span><span class="show-mobile">Tap on</span> the mood board to see the stakeholder's feedback as a heat map.</small>
        </div>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <p>I started this project by sketching a few ideas for both layouts and search interactions before diving into design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples slideshow">
        <ul class="slides">
            {% for sketch in page.yw_sketches %}
                <li class="slide"><img src="/img/projects/yachtworld/sketches/sketch-{{ sketch }}.jpg"></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>My goal</h3>
        <p>I wanted to create an aesthetic that reflected the type of clientele YachtWorld.com attracts. I was particularly interested in creating a sense of luxury by pairing good, simple typography with stylized images of yachts. I also wanted to use larger images in the listings. I designed several different aesthetic options for the home page, search results, and individual boat detail pages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples slideshow">
        <ul class="slides">
            {% for design in page.yw_designs %}
                <li class="slide"><img src="/img/projects/yachtworld/design/design-{{ design }}.jpg"></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h3>Bringing it together</h3>
        <p>After an initial round of designs, we engaged YachtWorld's users for another survey. This time, we showed them our design ideas and asked for their unfiltered input. The survey process yielded responses from "That's amazing!"<sup><a class="reference" id="yw-ref1" href="#yw-fn1">1</a></sup> to "Fire the designer. Now."<sup><a class="reference" id="yw-ref2" href="#yw-fn2">2</a></sup></p>
        <p>More than feedback about aesthetics, engaging an audience in this way bridges the divide between designers and "normal" users. There tends to be a slight disconnect at times for most designers, myself included, when it comes to making things for non-designers. Function matters just as much as form, and neither YachtWorld.com, nor its users, will reap benefits from a "pretty, but pointless"<sup><a class="reference" id="yw-ref3" href="#yw-fn3">3</a></sup> redesign.</p>
        <p>After processing the stakeholders' and users' feedback, I put together a design that appeased most aesthetically while providing the experience that YachtWorld.com was looking for. The designs below are slowly being integrated into the production site. If you're so inclined, you can take a peek at <a href="http://m.yachtworld.com">the mobile version</a> featuring most of my redesign now.</p>

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>Grooveshark engaged my team at Simple Focus at the earliest stage of the design process: concepting and ideating on innovative homepage ideas for a new version of Grooveshark.com, without any limitations. The reasoning behind the project was to bring an outside perspective to a product team that was deeply embedded in the current version of their&nbsp;app.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <p>I start most design projects on paper. The flexibility and freedom of sketching often leads to an outpouring of ideas. Some are good, most are bad, but they're all on paper (and out of my head), which is important. I challenge myself with an excercise called "4x4ing" – producing four crude but strategically different ideas in four minutes. The process is taxing, but forces me to move quickly and think on my feet. It usually produces fragments of solid ideas that can be pulled together into a few viable&nbsp;options.</p>

        <h3>The result</h3>
        <p>Over the course of a few days, I produced dozens of sketches and several high fidelity design ideas. The project was a success, and elements from a few of my designs are now in the core product direction of the next generation of Grooveshark's app. The screens below are a small sample of the designs I produced during the&nbsp;project.</p>

        <p class="description">Redesigning an outdated, overly complex enterprise application.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Asentinel’s eponymous telecommunication expense management app, which began its life on the Windows desktop, was ported to the web in the early 2000s. While progress was made on the backend in the years following, the user interface was left largely untouched. Asentinel approached my team to architect and design a better experience for their users. I was responsible for architecture, UX, design, and front-end prototyping.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Asentinel already carried an ancient UI, but it was exacerbated by the addition of one-off pieces of functionality added over the years. This resulted in an unintuitive experience that required a three day “training conference” to onboard new users whenever Asentinel brought on a new client.</p>
        <h3>My goal</h3>
        <p>Simplicity. Specifically, I wanted to reign in the architecture with a smart, intuitive navigation that emphasized commonly used features.</p>
        <p>Since Asentinel’s core functionality is processing and auditing invoices, I also wanted to create a simple dashboard that would give users the information most useful to them without having to dig through thousands of invoices and other documents.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <h4>Architecture</h4>
        <p>My team spent several hours with Asentinel’s product team breaking down architecture and user flows on a white board.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples slideshow">
        <ul class="slides">
            {% for whiteboard in page.asentinel_whiteboards %}
                <li class="slide"><img src="/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-{{ whiteboard }}.jpg"></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Asentinel’s clients, and even their clients’ users, rarely utilize the app the same way. A user’s role dictates what parts of the app they have access to. For example, a user may only handle disputing invoices with telecom vendors.</p>
        <p>We ended up with a much simpler architecture for the app.</p>
        <img src="/img/projects/asentinel/sitemap.jpg" alt="">
        <h4>Beginning design</h4>
        <p>I started the design process manually, on white boards and paper, and quickly moved to wire framing. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples slideshow">
        <ul class="slides">
            {% for wireframe in page.asentinel_wires %}
                <li class="slide"><img src="/img/projects/asentinel/wire-{{ wireframe }}.png"></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
       <p>I also designed high-fidelity wireframes of layouts and modules. Since the app is primarily information in tables, I wanted to explore handling tables responsively.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="examples">
        <div class="example"><img data-src="/img/projects/asentinel/hf-wire-1.jpg"></div>
        <div class="example"><img data-src="/img/projects/asentinel/hf-wire-2.jpg"></div>
        <div class="example"><img data-src="/img/projects/asentinel/hf-wire-3.jpg"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p>To introduce the idea of a dashboard, I built a prototype of the design.</p>
        <p><a href="http://work.zumwa.lt/as-design-prototype/" target="_blank">View the design prototype</a></p>
        <p>In order to understand the functional needs of Asentinel’s users, I started creating simple clickable prototypes early in the design process. Wanting to be able to test my ideas with real users, I ran an eye tracking study to test the flow of adding new service on the prototype below at Asentinel’s User Conference.</p>
        <p><a href="http://work.zumwa.lt/as-prototype/" target="_blank">View the clickable prototype</a></p>
        <h4>Getting into design</h4>
        <p>I had grand ideas for the application at first. Using my high-fidelity wireframes as a foundation, I designed a simple, fresh aesthetic with a focus on color and typography. I also designed a dashboard to give users a quick glance at the information that matters most to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples slideshow">
        <ul class="slides">
            {% for design in page.asentinel_designs %}
                <li class="slide"><img src="/img/projects/asentinel/design-{{ design }}.jpg"></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Asentinel is first and foremost a utility, though. I learned quickly that the aesthetic I was pursuing didn’t serve the users well. Though attractive, it put utility in the backseat on the larger, data-heavy views. I subsequently explored a simpler aesthetic, with clear typography and calls to action. As the views of the app largely revolve around large tables, I wanted to take extra care to make them easily scannable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples slideshow">
        <ul class="slides">
            {% for design in page.asentinel_finals %}
                <li class="slide"><img src="/img/projects/asentinel/final-{{ design }}.jpg"></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The design was intended to be refreshing, but familiar. I simplified the navigation, nesting many of the lesser-used items into a dropdown.</p>
        <h3>Sometimes things don’t work out</h3>
        <p>In the end, budgets change, people leave organizations, and priorities shift. Asentinel went down this path, and it’s possible that the redesign my team worked so diligently on may never see the light of day. At the very least, it was an unparalleled learning experience.</p>

        <p class="description">A new strategy and redesign for an under-developed brand.</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Along with BoatTrader.com and Yachtworld.com, Boats.com is a boating classifieds site from Dominion Marine Media (DMM). The largest of the three, it combines listings from both of the sites mentioned above with a large amount of boating lifestyle content. Outside of the US, it also serves as DMM’s primary brand. DMM approached my team to redefine Boats.com’s strategy, design, and experience. I was responsible for architecture, design, and front-end prototyping.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Boats.com was a site without direction or qualities to differentiate it from its siblings. Its core strength is its lifestyle content, which was being relegated to a small carousel on the home page.</p>
        <h3>My goal</h3>
        <p>I wanted to make boating lifestyle content the highlight of the site. Classifieds are also important, as they’re revenue generating, so integrating them in a smart way was also key.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>As with the other DMM projects, my team performed in depth research with users of Boats.com before we started the design process. We sent a survey to ~10,000 consumers, asking them about their experience buying and selling boats, and how Boats.com served them in those roles. As expected, their feedback was very valuable.</p>
        <h4>Architecture</h4>
        <p>“Getting it right” on Boats.com required revisiting its architecture. My team evaluated the sites’s content, including its library of over 1000 articles, to make informed navigation and taxonomy changes. We created navigational flows and wireframes to explore these changes.</p>

            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>Mood boards</h4>
        <p>As this was the third project I’d worked on with the DMM team, I had insight from the first two to guide my decision making. As with those sites, I started the project with a mood board exercise to gauge brand perception within the stakeholder group.</p>

        <h4>Design</h4>
        <p>I designed a few options for both mobile and desktop based around Boats.com’s existing brand standards and color palette.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Along with YachtWorld.com and Boats.com, BoatTrader.com is a long-standing boating classifieds site from Dominion Marine Media (DMM). As the largest of its online properties, BoatTrader.com gets in excess of 30 million page views a year. DMM approached my team to redefine the site’s design and experience. I was responsible for design and front-end prototyping.</p>
        <h3>The problem</h3>
        <p>Boat Trader’s website was successful and highly trafficked, but the design left a lot to be desired. Coupled with a limited mobile site, the overall user experience was due for an upgrade.</p>
        <h3>My goal</h3>
        <p>I wanted to bring BoatTrader.com into the era of mobile-first thinking. I wanted a design that worked well on any device, with an emphasis on an easy to use search and navigation and a clean, accessible aesthetic.</p>
        <h3>My process</h3>
        <h4>Research</h4>
        <p>My team performed in depth research by surveying nearly 10,000 users of BoatTrader.com, asking them about their experience buying and selling boats, and how Boat Trader served them in those roles. As expected, their feedback was valuable, and we covered the walls of our office with insight from the users. We also created personas for typical users of the site.</p>
