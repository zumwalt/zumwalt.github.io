In my time working with CBT, the app’s user base has more than doubled to nearly&nbsp;90,000.</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>CrossBrowserTesting.com has always had a strong product &mdash; easy testing of websites across multiple operating systems and browsers from a single computer. When I began working on the product, the UI was clunky and outdated, with bits and pieces of open source design frameworks and icon packs scattered about. Launching a live test was overly complex and difficult to navigate. My first order of business was to dream up a simpler&nbsp;experience.</p><h3>My process</h3><p>I began the project on paper, sketching several ideas for the core functionality of the app at the time &mdash; choosing a browser and operating system to&nbsp;test.</p></div><div class=examples><div class=example><img src=/img/projects/cbt/sketches/sketch-1.bd4c.jpg alt="Sketches of CrossBrowserTesting's live test picker"></div></div><div class=content><p>My next step was diving head-first into the UI. Based around a common color palette, I explored both the aesthetic of the overall site as well as the specific interactions of the live test&nbsp;picker.</p></div><div class="examples slideshow"><ul class=slides><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/cbt/design/design-1.737a.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/cbt/design/design-2.b793.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/cbt/design/design-3.30f0.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/cbt/design/design-4.e6fb.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/cbt/design/design-5.d99b.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/cbt/design/design-6.6e6f.jpg></li></ul></div><div class=content><h3>Bringing it together</h3><p>In the end, the team at CrossBrowserTesting.com went with a simple UI that's still evolving&nbsp;today.</p><img class=picker src=/img/projects/cbt/picker.2e4e.gif alt=""> <img class=picker src=/img/projects/cbt/ss-picker.6a9d.gif alt=""></div><div class=content><p>Since I began the project, the app has grown to include screenshot testing and automated Selenium testing.
