It tracks a few simple metrics, like status and percent complete, to help us quickly understand what each team member is working on. As we begin to introduce the product to outside users and teams, I'm redesigning the marketing site to better showcase Project List's features and&nbsp;benefits.</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>Project List's <a href=http://projectlist.com rel=noreferrer>current marketing site</a> is a bit limited in the way it's designed (by myself, admittedly). It is difficult to add new content, and the site wasn't designed with collecting payments or adding outside users in&nbsp;mind.</p><h3>My goal</h3><p>I wanted to give Project List a proper marketing site &mdash; one that can grow as the product does. The site should be able to support multiple pages of content and entice users to sign&nbsp;up.</p><h3>My process</h3><p>As this is an internal, non-billing project, my time was limited. I dove in head first with a few sketches to quickly get ideas on&nbsp;paper.</p></div><div class="examples slideshow"><ul class=slides><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-1.ad7c.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-2.1ef3.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-3.277e.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-4.3f1c.jpg></li></ul></div><div class=content><h3>Bringing it together</h3><p>In the end, I made the decision to promote Project List's responsive, mobile-first view. Standup meetings are often held away from desks and laptops, so I want users to know that Project List works on their phones. I chose a simple color palette and aesthetic with a focus on typography. I also added a few illustrative elements to accompany Project List's mascot, the Project List Robot. The screens below are snippets of a few pages from the new&nbsp;site.</p><p data-height=584 data-theme-id=12456 data-slug-hash=yyKOXR data-default-tab=result data-user=zumwalt class=codepen>See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/zumwalt/pen/yyKOXR/">Animated Robot</a> by Casey Zumwalt (<a href=http://codepen.io/zumwalt>@zumwalt</a>) on <a href=http://codepen.io>CodePen</a>.</p><script async src=//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js></script></div><div class=examples><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/home-small-1.98cc.jpg data-full=/img/projects/project-list/home.7076.jpg></div><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/home-small-2.18c6.jpg data-full=/img/projects/project-list/home.7076.jpg></div><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/robots-small.4bb3.jpg></div><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/about-small.f94d.jpg data-full=/img/projects/project-list/about.7354.jpg></div><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/features-small.1c08.jpg data-full=/img/projects/project-list/features.11ca.jpg></div></div><footer><div class=up-next><small>Up Next</small> <a data-load=grooveshark><h2>Grooveshark</h2></a><p>A no-limits redesign for a streaming music app.</p></div></footer></div>
