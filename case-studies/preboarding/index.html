It serves as a way to create a visual vocabulary when they speak about their brand. What <em>does</em> "clean" actually mean when it comes to&nbsp;design?</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>As a stakeholder, contributing to a mood board is difficult if you can't be in the room. I find mood boards, and the insight they provide, to be invaluable when I get into the design process, so I wanted to create a solution that allowed remote stakeholders to contribute from anywhere. Why not build an&nbsp;app?</p><h3>My goal</h3><p>I wanted to build an app that allowed individual users to collaborate in real time with their fellow stakeholders by placing "stickers" on different elements of a mood board. I wanted each sticker to contain the user's initials and a color reflecting their opinion (green for "on brand", red for "off brand", and blue for "aspirational"). I also wanted to be able to watch the exercise unfold in real time in my&nbsp;browser.</p><h3>My process</h3><img src=/img/projects/preboarding/whiteboard.b80d.jpg><p>I quickly sketched out a few of the core concepts on a whiteboard to get them out of my head. I chose Ruby on Rails as my framework due to its learning curve. I scaffolded out a simple application, added authentication with <a href=https://github.com/plataformatec/devise>Devise</a>, and built a mood board model and its accompanying controllers and views. Using the scaffolded CRUD interface for the mood board model, I added simple file uploading with <a href=https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip>Paperclip</a>. To enable real time communication between the different users of the apps, I integrated <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> to enable websocket connections between clients.</p><h3>Bringing it together</h3><p>Contrary to my nature, I saved design for last. I put together a simple UI for the app as a whole, and designed microinteractions for the addition and removal of the "stickers". The app is simple, nimble, and serves its purpose well. With everything in place, I have an interface that allows me to upload mood boards and allows stakeholders to interact with them. I can watch everything happen in real time, take notes, and ask informed questions afterwards. As a result, I'm able to have a clearer understanding of the stakeholders' brand and their expectations before I get too far into the design&nbsp;process.</p></div><div class=examples><div class="example video"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/119037999?autoplay=1&loop=1&color=fb7560&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width=500 height=278 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><footer><div class=up-next><small>Up Next</small> <a href=#project-list><h2>Project List</h2></a><p>A marketing site for a team productivity app.</p></div></footer></div>
