In my time working with CBT, the app’s user base has more than doubled to nearly&nbsp;90,000.</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>CrossBrowserTesting.com has always had a strong product &mdash; easy testing of websites across multiple operating systems and browsers from the comfort of your computer. When I began working on the product, the UI was clunky and outdated, with bits and pieces of open source design frameworks and icon packs scattered about. Launching a live test was difficult to navigate, with a table based and overly complex UI. My first order of business was to dream up a simpler experience.</p><h3>My process</h3><p>I began the project on paper. I sketched several ideas for the core functionality of the app at the time &mdash; choosing a browser and operating system to test.</p></div><div class=examples><div class=example><img src=/img/projects/cbt/sketches/sketch-1.bd4c.jpg alt="Sketches of CrossBrowserTesting's live test picker"></div></div><div class=content><p>My next step was diving head-first into the UI.

It tracks a few simple metrics, like status and percent complete, to help us quickly understand what each team member is working on. As we begin to introduce the product to outside users and teams, I'm redesigning the marketing site to better showcase Project List's features and&nbsp;benefits.</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>Project List's <a href=http://projectlist.com rel=noreferrer>current marketing site</a> is a bit limited in the way it's designed (by myself, admittedly). It is difficult to add new content, and the site wasn't designed with collecting payments or adding outside users in&nbsp;mind.</p><h3>My goal</h3><p>I wanted to give Project List a proper marketing site &mdash; one that can grow as the product does. The site should be able to support multiple pages of content and entice users to sign&nbsp;up.</p><h3>My process</h3><p>As this is an internal, non-billing project, my time was limited. I dove in head first with a few sketches to quickly get ideas on&nbsp;paper.</p></div><div class="examples slideshow"><ul class=slides><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-1.ad7c.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-2.1ef3.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-3.277e.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/project-list/sketches/sketch-4.3f1c.jpg></li></ul></div><div class=content><h3>Bringing it together</h3><p>In the end, I made the decision to promote Project List's responsive, mobile-first view. Standup meetings are often held away from desks and laptops, so I want users to know that Project List works on their phones. I chose a simple color palette and aesthetic with a focus on typography. I also added a few illustrative elements to accompany Project List's mascot, the Project List Robot. The screens below are snippets of a few pages from the new&nbsp;site.</p></div><div class=examples><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/home-small-1.98cc.jpg data-full=/img/projects/project-list/home.7076.jpg></div><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/home-small-2.18c6.jpg data-full=/img/projects/project-list/home.7076.jpg></div><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/robots-small.4bb3.jpg></div><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/about-small.f94d.jpg data-full=/img/projects/project-list/about.7354.jpg></div><div class=example><img data-src=/img/projects/project-list/features-small.1c08.jpg data-full=/img/projects/project-list/features.11ca.jpg></div></div><footer><div class=up-next><small>Up Next</small> <a href=#grooveshark><h2>Grooveshark</h2></a><p>A no-limits redesign for a streaming music app.</p></div></footer></div><div class=project id=preboarding><div class=return><a href=#>&larr; Back to Recent Work</a></div><header><h2 class=title>Preboarding</h2><p class=description>An app for facilitating mood board exercises.</p></header><div class=content><p>My team at Simple Focus often does mood board exercises with clients at the beginning of projects. It serves as a way to create a visual vocabulary when they speak about their brand. What <em>does</em> "clean" actually mean when it comes to&nbsp;design?</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>As a stakeholder, contributing to a mood board is difficult if you can't be in the room. I find mood boards, and the insight they provide, to be invaluable when I get into the design process, so I wanted to create a solution that allowed remote stakeholders to contribute from anywhere. Why not build an&nbsp;app?</p><h3>My goal</h3><p>I wanted to build an app that allowed individual users to collaborate in real time with their fellow stakeholders by placing "stickers" on different elements of a mood board. I wanted each sticker to contain the user's initials and a color reflecting their opinion (green for "on brand", red for "off brand", and blue for "aspirational"). I also wanted to be able to watch the exercise unfold in real time in my&nbsp;browser.</p><h3>My process</h3><img src=/img/projects/preboarding/whiteboard.b80d.jpg><p>I quickly sketched out a few of the core concepts on a whiteboard to get them out of my head. I chose Ruby on Rails as my framework due to its learning curve. I scaffolded out a simple application, added authentication with <a href=https://github.com/plataformatec/devise>Devise</a>, and built a mood board model and its accompanying controllers and views. Using the scaffolded CRUD interface for the mood board model, I added simple file uploading with <a href=https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip>Paperclip</a>. To enable real time communication between the different users of the apps, I integrated <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> to enable websocket connections between clients.</p><h3>Bringing it together</h3><p>Contrary to my nature, I saved design for last. I put together a simple UI for the app as a whole, and designed microinteractions for the addition and removal of the "stickers". The app is simple, nimble, and serves its purpose well. With everything in place, I have an interface that allows me to upload mood boards and allows stakeholders to interact with them. I can watch everything happen in real time, take notes, and ask informed questions afterwards. As a result, I'm able to have a clearer understanding of the stakeholders' brand and their expectations before I get too far into the design&nbsp;process.</p></div><div class=examples><div class="example video"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/119037999?autoplay=1&loop=1&color=fb7560&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width=500 height=278 frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><footer><div class=up-next><small>Up Next</small> <a href=#project-list><h2>Project List</h2></a><p>A marketing site for a team productivity app.</p></div></footer></div><div class=project id=yachtworld><div class=return><a href=#>&larr; Back to Recent Work</a></div><header><h2 class=title>YachtWorld</h2><p class=description>A design overhaul for a neglected high-end classifieds&nbsp;site.</p></header><div class=content><p>My team at Simple Focus was engaged to redesign YachtWorld.com to reflect their users and the watercraft they feature. I was responsible for the design process and front-end prototyping.</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>For a site that nets around 20 million visits a year, YachtWorld.com is outdated, slow, and a pain to use. The process of searching for boats is overly complex and poorly designed, and the individual boat listings are busy and often uninformative.</p><h3>Doing our research</h3><p>Before thinking about design, my team conducted in-depth research and user interviews to gauge perception of YachtWorld.com and its user base. We asked them about themselves, their experiences buying and selling boats, and their interaction with YachtWorld.com in that capacity. We also performed a heuristic review of the site to identify existing UX problems and possible solutions, and we performed a competitive analysis of YachtWorld.com to contrast it with its competitors. As a last step before diving into design, I designed and led a mood board exercise with stakeholders from YachtWorld.com's team. The mood board gave me insight into how each stakeholder viewed YachtWorld.com's brand and the aspirations they had for the brand going forward. Armed with all of this information, I began the design process.</p></div><div class="examples moodboard"><div class=example><img src=/img/projects/yachtworld/moodboard.09b8.jpg alt=""> <img class=heatmap src=/img/projects/yachtworld/moodboard-heatmap.cfbc.jpg alt=""> <small>Tip: <span class=show-desktop>Hover over</span><span class=show-mobile>Tap on</span> the mood board to see the stakeholder's feedback as a heat map.</small></div></div><div class=content><h3>My process</h3><p>I started this project by sketching a few ideas for both layouts and search interactions before diving into design.</p></div><div class="examples slideshow"><ul class=slides><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/yachtworld/sketches/sketch-1.00dd.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/yachtworld/sketches/sketch-2.9920.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/yachtworld/sketches/sketch-3.e7a6.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/yachtworld/sketches/sketch-4.380a.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/yachtworld/sketches/sketch-5.f757.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/yachtworld/sketches/sketch-6.7b86.jpg></li></ul></div><div class=content><h3>My goal</h3><p>I wanted to create an aesthetic that reflected the type of clientele YachtWorld.com attracts.

The reasoning behind the project was to bring an outside perspective to a product team that was deeply embedded in the current version of their&nbsp;app.</p><h3>My process</h3><p>I start most design projects on paper. The flexibility and freedom of sketching often leads to an outpouring of ideas. Some are good, most are bad, but they're all on paper (and out of my head), which is important. I challenge myself with an excercise called "4x4ing" – producing four crude but strategically different ideas in four minutes. The process is taxing, but forces me to move quickly and think on my feet. It usually produces fragments of solid ideas that can be pulled together into a few viable&nbsp;options.</p></div><div class="examples slideshow"><ul class=slides><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-1.b76e.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-2.0e7a.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-3.8377.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-4.4e46.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-5.c581.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-6.95f9.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-7.edb4.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-8.0d0c.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-9.e8f5.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/grooveshark/sketches/sketch-10.ac0f.jpg></li></ul></div><div class=content><h3>The result</h3><p>Over the course of a few days, I produced dozens of sketches and several high fidelity design ideas.

While progress was made on the backend in the years following, the user interface was left largely untouched. Asentinel approached my team to architect and design a better experience for their users. I was responsible for architecture, UX, design, and front-end prototyping.</p><h3>The problem</h3><p>Asentinel already carried an ancient UI, but it was exacerbated by the addition of one-off pieces of functionality added over the years. This resulted in an unintuitive experience that required a three day “training conference” to onboard new users whenever Asentinel brought on a new client.</p><h3>My goal</h3><p>Simplicity. Specifically, I wanted to reign in the architecture with a smart, intuitive navigation that emphasized commonly used features.</p><p>Since Asentinel’s core functionality is processing and auditing invoices, I also wanted to create a simple dashboard that would give users the information most useful to them without having to dig through thousands of invoices and other documents.</p><h3>My process</h3><h4>Architecture</h4><p>My team spent several hours with Asentinel’s product team breaking down architecture and user flows on a white board.</p></div><div class="examples slideshow"><ul class=slides><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-1.b1b2.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-2.5043.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-3.46f5.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-4.380f.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-5.58cc.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-6.29eb.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-7.0cd5.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-8.8d0e.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-9.5d45.jpg></li><li class=slide><img src=/img/projects/asentinel/white-board-10.5315.jpg></li></ul></div><div class=content><p>Asentinel’s clients, and even their clients’ users, rarely utilize the app the same way.

DMM approached my team to redefine Boats.com’s strategy, design, and experience.

Its core strength is its lifestyle content, which was being relegated to a small carousel on the home page.</p><h3>My goal</h3><p>I wanted to make boating lifestyle content the highlight of the site. Classifieds are also important, as they’re revenue generating, so integrating them in a smart way was also key.</p><h3>My process</h3><h4>Research</h4><p>As with the other DMM projects, my team performed in depth research with users of Boats.com before we started the design process.

As expected, their feedback was very valuable.</p><h4>Architecture</h4><p>“Getting it right” on Boats.com required revisiting its architecture.
